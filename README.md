# Stock-Price-Prediction-and-Forecasting
- LSTM Model for predicting and forecasting the stock price predictions
#
-This project focuses on predicting stock prices using a deep learning model, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to handle sequence prediction problems by learning from historical time series data. The goal is to predict future stock prices based on past trends, offering valuable insights for investors and traders.
-Predicting stock prices is inherently difficult due to market volatility and the complex interactions of various external factors. Traditional statistical methods struggle with long-range dependencies in time series data. LSTM networks, however, excel at capturing both short and long-term trends, making them highly effective for time series forecasting.
  -The objective of this project is to:
  -Build and train an LSTM model using historical stock price data.
  -Evaluate the performance of the model in predicting stock prices.
  -Plot and compare actual vs. predicted stock prices to analyze the modelâ€™s accuracy.
